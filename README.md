## mycelium: The underground network for your code

Mycelium is a small, simple programming language created as a personal project to learn about language design, interpreters, and what goes on under the hood of my favorite programming languages.

The interpreter is written in Go. I chose Go because I enjoy the language and want to build a more solid foundation with it. Additionally, Go offers great performance while remaining simple and easy to learn.

This project is built by following Thorsten Ball's excellent book, [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/). I highly recommend it to anyone interested in building their own language or understanding the concepts on which mycelium is built.
